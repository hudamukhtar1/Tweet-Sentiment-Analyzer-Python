# Tweet-Sentiment-Analyzer-Python-
The project contains the module sentiment_analysis.py and a main program, main.py, that analyzes Twitter information
through sentiment analysis.
The Twitter data contains tweets from individuals across the United States. 
The program takes in the name of the file with the data (location coordinates, region, date, time and tweet) and determines 
which region is the happiest based on key words in the tweets.
